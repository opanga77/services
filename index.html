<h1>Basic car maintainance & Service</h1>
<p>It’s the same with your body – you know it needs regular maintenance.
     If you’re smart, you eat decent food, get the sleep you need to function,
      hit the gym now and then and visit the doctor if something isn’t working right.
       It’s just common sense</p>
       <p>But what about <srong>your</srong> car?</p>
       <em><h2>Here are some basic tips to help you increase your car perfomance</h2></em>
       <p>Keeping your car in tip-top condition keeps you safer on the road and can save you heaps of money in the long-term. When it comes to your vehicle, prevention is 1000 times better than cure.
            Basic upkeep is cheaper than major repairs caused by <strong>neglect</strong>.</p>
            <h2>Read the owner's manual</h2>
            <img src="https://bit.ly/397sLTi">
            <p>Your car service manual may not be quite as exciting to read as the latest bestselling novel, but it’s full of handy information and tips: which fluids to top up (and how often),
                 how to check tyre pressure, what to do when your engine overheats and how to change the bulbs in your blinker lights. It will tell you how to perform basic maintenance jobs the correct way.</p>
                 <h2>Check fluids</h2>
                 <img src="https://bit.ly/2SeXbfL">
                 <p>Most cars will use the following fluids: engine oil, radiator coolant, automatic transmission fluid, windscreen washer fluid, brake fluid, clutch fluid,
                      power steering fluid, battery electrolyte fluid (distilled water) and possibly more depending on the vehicle type. Check fluids regularly, and replace when needed.</p>
                      <h2>Check engine air filter</h2>

                      <p>The more stop-start driving you do and the <strong>dustier</strong> the roads you drive on, the more often it’ll need a change.</p>
